Reason for Project:
I got a large speaker for free from an old school class. This speaker was simply a two input audio speaker, but I had nothing I could use it for. I decided that I wanted to turn it into a bluetooth speaker. I want to also be able to control this speaker as if it was just a normal commerical speaker. This would mean I would need some sort of bluetooth controller that I could use for Audio + Button control. 

After going through the design process, I decided on using a bluetooth aplifier as my method for driving the speaker audio. My original idea of making this powered through a microcontroller was abandoed after I was unable to amplify an audio signal that was as clean as I was envisioning. I tried using a Class B auido amplifier from my courses, but there was a level of noise that I was unable to reduce to an acceptable level. This turned this speaker into being bluetooth controlled using a microcontroller rather than both audio and control.

Additionally I also decided that adding a mini display would make this project more unique from the commerical speakers. I originally wanted to make the speaker display the current song title and album cover, but after long investiagtion and error, I was out of flash memory space for my project. I ended up deciding that I would just like a simple image to be displayed on the display.
